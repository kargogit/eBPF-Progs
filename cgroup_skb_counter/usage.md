//Usage and Testing
1. **Build the program**
   ```
   make
   ```
   This produces `cgroup_counter_user`.

2. **Create a test cgroup (requires cgroup v2, which is default on modern distros)**
   ```
   sudo mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/my-test-group
   ```

3. **Run the counter (must be root)**
   ```
   sudo ./cgroup_counter_user /sys/fs/cgroup/my-test-group
   ```
   You will see a header and live per-second rates for ingress/egress packets and bits.

4. **Generate traffic inside the cgroup**
   In another terminal:
   ```
   sudo bash -c 'echo $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/my-test-group/cgroup.procs && ping -c 20 8.8.8.8'
   ```
   - Outgoing ICMP requests → **Egress** increases.
   - Incoming ICMP replies → **Ingress** increases.
   - Both pkt/s and bit/s should show non-zero values (typically ~2 pkt/s each direction for ping).

   You can also run any network tool (curl, wget, nc, etc.) inside that subshell.

5. **What to look for**
   - Non-zero pkt/s and bit/s when traffic is generated by processes in the cgroup.
   - Zero rates when no processes are in the cgroup or no network activity.
   - Ingress counts incoming packets received on sockets owned by processes in the cgroup.
   - Egress counts outgoing packets sent from those sockets.
   - This only counts TCP/UDP/ICMP etc. (socket-based traffic), not raw packets or XDP-level.
   - Rates are Layer 2 (include Ethernet headers if applicable, but on most setups it's IP-level size).

6. **Verify attachment (optional)**
   ```
   sudo bpftool cgroup show /sys/fs/cgroup/my-test-group
   ```
   Should list two attached program IDs (one for ingress, one for egress).

7. **Stop**
   Ctrl+C in the counter terminal → it detaches the programs and exits cleanly.

8. **Cleanup cgroup**
   ```
   sudo rmdir /sys/fs/cgroup/my-test-group
